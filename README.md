# Lyapunov Exponent Informed Adversarial Attacks
 This repository replicates some of the results from, ["Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents of Deep Neural Networks" from Physical Review Letters 132, 057301 by L. Storm, H. Linander,  J. Bec, K. Gustavsson, and B. Mehlig (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.057301).

This was done to check that the computation of the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLEs) was implemented correctly. 

As of writing the author plans to re-implement more parts of the Storm2024 paper, add adversalial attacks, and investidate if the FTLEs can be used to make better adversarial attacks.  

## Installation
In a terminal copy the following set of commands
```
conda create --name lyap_exp_attacks
conda activate lyap_exp_attacks
git clone https://github.com/sdekhterman/pytorch_lyapunov_exponent_adversal_attacks.git
cd pytorch_lyapunov_exponent_adversal_attacks
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
